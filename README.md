# @TLabs/Models

Typescript interfaces + mongoose schemas combined into one to be used across all ThamesLabs Projects

## Getting Started

```
yarn add @tlabs/models
```

## Built With

-   [Typegoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typegoose) - Used to generate types + mongoose schemas as a singleton via decorators;

We initially built it with ts-mongoose but it kept breaking.
